          September 11, 2021 is the 20th Anniversary of the tragic attack on our country and has
          been designated as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. As a tribute to those who
          were killed and injured on that day, and to honor the first responders and countless
          others who serve to defend our nationâ€™s freedom at home and abroad, we would like to unite
          together as a community and participate in a day of service.
